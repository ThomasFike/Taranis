# Taranis
## Description
Taranis is a project started by Thomas Fike to create an AWOS system to generate weater reports. Note this is a personal project that I work on in my free time Then there will be many ways to access this data. The plan at this time is to have it operate using normal wall power although a remove version could be made in the future.
### Where the name comes from
Taranis is the Celtic God of thunder so I thought it appropriate considering this project is about weather.
